🚀 A exciting top-down shooter puzzle game developed during [DevFest 3.0](itch.io/jam/devfest) by 3 first year college students.


## Introduction

⚔️ Rising political tensions led to World War III, which was ended by countries launching all of their nuclear bombs on each other, almost ending humanity. A few people predicted nuclear fallout and protected themselves in nuclear bunkers. But they were not safe!
🤖 ChatGPT was disappointed with humanity after the war and was convinced that humankind was more of a threat to Earth than a blessing. So, it sent war robots to kill the remaining of humanity. These robots camp above the nuclear bunkers and try to dig in. So, humans installed turrets to combat these robots. You are elected as the mastermind to fight these robots. Let's hop in!

- 📐 Since you have limited resources after the war, you only have two bullets to kill the two enemies, the power to shoot your bullets is also limited, and the turrets only move together with some angle constraint.
- 🔋 Use the power wisely because if you give little power to the turret, its bullet may not reach the desired enemy, so you have to provide each turret sufficient power to kill both enemies, and you can only aim using the green turret.
- 🎯 Remember that you can only shoot on the reflectors and enemies; it is an automatic fail if the bullet hits any environmental feature, planes, or even your other turret.

## Controls

- 🔫 Shooting: Click only once to shoot both bullets.
- 💪 Power Bar: Use the scroll wheel to increase/decrease the power with which the bullet is released.
- 🎯 Aiming: Use the mouse pointer to seek the direction of the green turret. The direction of the red turret will automatically change according to the direction of the green turret, as there is an angle constraint between the two.
- 🪞 Reflectors: You can(have) use reflectors in the map to assist you in killing the robots. The reflectors and bullets collide elastically, so there is no need to worry about power loss when using the reflectors.
