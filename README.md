ðŸš€ A exciting top-down shooter puzzle game developed during [DevFest 3.0](itch.io/jam/devfest) by 3 first year college students


## Introduction

Rising political tensions lead to World War III, which was ended by countries launching all of their nuclear bombs on each other, almost ending humanity. A few people predicted nuclear fallout and protected themselves in nuclear bunkers. But they were not safe!
ChatGPT was disappointed with humanity after the war, and was convinced that humankind is more of a threat to Earth than blessing. So it sent war robots to kill the remaining of humankind. These robots camp above the nuclear bunkers and try to dig in. So humans installed turrets to combat these robots. You are elected as the mastermind to combat these robots. Let's hop in!
